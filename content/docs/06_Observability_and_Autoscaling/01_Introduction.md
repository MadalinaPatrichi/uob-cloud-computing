This chapter is concerned with two "Cloud-Native" concepts: 

- Observability, which includes metrics and external observability of the system, and 
- Autoscaling, which will allow the app to automatically trigger the provisioning of more or less infrastructure resources as the load on the app changes. 
 
These concepts are very important in eliminating large amounts of "toil" or manual work that requires a developer to be in attendance.

## Major key points:

- Why do we care about how an app behaves?
- What do we measure?
- Exposing data to make the service more "observable"
- How do we respond to the measurements?
- Overview of Autoscaling with VM's, Docker, and Kubernetes

**Note**: the tutorial content in these pages will go into more depth than the lectures. The lectures will attempt to highlight the most important concepts but it is advised that you read through the content here for a deeper explanation.
