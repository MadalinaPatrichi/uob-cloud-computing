# Course Content

The course content source is held in a Gitbooks format. To interact with this content you should use a `gitbooks` cli or view the raw markdown directly.

The suggested development method is the following:

1. Install `gitbooks-cli` NPM package (you'll need node, and npm setup on your machine)

    - Alternatively, use a Docker image that packages `gitbooks` for you

2. To start the server execute `gitbooks serve` in this `/content` directory.

This will hot reload the content as you modify it.
