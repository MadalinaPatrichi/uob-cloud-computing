Name: 'CREATE USER'
Description:
Syntax:
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS]
    user [auth_option] [, user [auth_option]] ...
    [REQUIRE {NONE | tls_option [[AND] tls_option] ...}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option] ...]
    [password_option | lock_option] ...

user:
    (see )

auth_option: {
    IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string'
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin BY 'auth_string'
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin AS 'hash_string'
  | IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'hash_string'
}

tls_option: {
   SSL
 | X509
 | CIPHER 'cipher'
 | ISSUER 'issuer'
 | SUBJECT 'subject'
}

resource_option: {
    MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS count
}

password_option: {
    PASSWORD EXPIRE
  | PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT
  | PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER
  | PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL N DAY
}

lock_option: {
    ACCOUNT LOCK
  | ACCOUNT UNLOCK
}

The CREATE USER statement creates new MySQL accounts. It enables
authentication, SSL/TLS, resource-limit, and password-management
properties to be established for new accounts, and controls whether
accounts are initially locked or unlocked.

To use CREATE USER, you must have the global CREATE USER privilege, or
the INSERT privilege for the mysql database. When the read_only system
variable is enabled, CREATE USER additionally requires the SUPER
privilege.

An error occurs if you try to create an account that already exists. If
the IF NOT EXISTS clause is given, the statement produces a warning for
each named account that already exists, rather than an error.
