# Observability and autoscaling of the Spring Bootstrap app

This chapter is concerned with two "Cloud-Native" concepts: Observability, which includes metrics and external observability of the system; and Autoscaling, which will allow the app to automatically trigger the provisioning of more or less infrastructure resources as the load on the app changes. These concepts are very important in eliminating large amounts of "toil" or manual work that requires a developer to be attendance.

#### Major key points:

- Adding metrics to the app (what do we measure?)
- How do we respond to the measurements?
- Exposing data to make the service more "observable"
- Overview of Autoscaling with VM's, Docker, and Kubernetes

**Note**: the tutorial content in these pages will go into more depth than the lectures. The lectures will attemp to highlight the most important concepts but it is advised that you read through the tutorials here for a deeper explanation.
