##### Training outline:

```
Containers are one of the building blocks of Cloud Native Computing.

Cloud Native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as Microservices, packaging each part into its own container,
and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilisation.

A container is a distribution bundle in which you package your application code binary with all configurations and dependencies. They share a host operating system but run in isolated processes making them more efficient considering resource utilisation and faster in start up time.

Containers ease the building, packaging and running of applications, increasing developer productivity and savings in operational costs.

In this hands on training you learn the basics of containers and how they fit into DevOps processes in the Cloud.

- What are containers and how they fit into software delivery lifecycle?
- Essential commands and basics of operation
- Monitoring, troubleshooting and security considerations
- Orchestration

Working experience with some programming language is recommended, but not mandatory. We will be concentrating on containerisation agnostic to programming language specifics.

We have multiple instructors on-site so we can break down the group according to experience level. Containerisation is also a great way to start to learn coding!

Eclipse Che development environments will be deployed to each participant on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
